**CAR COLOR PREDICTION IN TRAFFIC**

This is a project to detect the color of a particuar car in the traffic. 

It is made by using the library "colorthief" and other familier libraries. Here you will find 3 py file , in which the color_classifiaction is for color classifaction and detection for the cars. 
then next two files , knn_classification is having the code to train and clean the data , and the color_his file is the feature extraction file or the main file . 
I have used traffic video image on which I have tested the model.
